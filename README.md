# Password-Based-Door-Lock
In this project, an 8051 microcontroller was micro programmed in C and was used for operating a password protected door lock system integrated with motion sensor. The motion sensor principally operated by reflection of IR rays.
Install Keil uVision5 or any latest version.
Convert the 3 files into hex files using Keil software.
Install Proteus or any other simulation software.
Simulate the design of the door lock system. Import the hex file and run the simulation to test the system.
After successfully testing the simulatio, implement the same in the hardware.
